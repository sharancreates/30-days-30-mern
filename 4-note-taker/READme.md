# Note Taker

A nostalgic, typewriter-styled note-taking application built with the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
This project demonstrates **server-side date filtering**, allowing users to query notes created within a specific date range (handling timestamps from `00:00:00` to `23:59:59`). The frontend is built with **Vite** for speed and styled with custom CSS to mimic old paper and mechanical typing.
